Hi! 
I’m Sarah Radway, a second year PhD student in Computer Science. I am a 2022 NSF Graduate Research Fellow, interested in writing policy-informed technical works in the security and privacy realm.

In recent good news, this year I co-first authored this [paper](https://www.computer.org/csdl/proceedings-article/sp/2022/131600b564/1CIO8gLsq2c), which I presented at [FCSM 2021](https://fcsm2021.org/), [Oakland (IEEE S&P 2022)](https://www.ieee-security.org/TC/SP2022/), and most recently, at the [National Academies CNSTAT 2020 Census Data Products Workshop](https://www.nationalacademies.org/our-work/2020-census-data-products-workshop-on-the-demographic-and-housing-characteristics-files) last summer. This work contextualizes the U.S. Census Bureau’s transition to differential privacy through an in-depth comparison with swapping (the de-identification method used by the Census Bureau in 2010). Our presentations focus on data privacy and utility, exploring issues surrounding minority underrepresentation, group size, and the single-year-of-age use case.

These days, I'm working (1) on questions about virtual reality data privacy and (2) in the anonymous communications space.
